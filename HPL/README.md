HPL1 Engine - Rehatched
=======================

This is the game engine that powers the Penumbra Series of games made by [Frictional Games](https://frictionalgames.com/).

It has been modified and modernised to be able to be compiled with current (2020-21) compilers and toolsets. The original sources are available from [Frictional Games' HPL1Engine repo](https://github.com/FrictionalGames/HPL1Engine).

Currently, only an Xcode project for macOS development is included, but the source itself is cross platform.
The included CMake project is out of date.
